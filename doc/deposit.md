How to deposit $TBY
===============

1. Go to exchange, choose Polygon Mainnet and swap preferred token to DE token. Contract address – 0x081Ec4c0e30159C8259BAD8F4887f83010a681DC

2. Go to [DeNet Payments](https://pay.denet.app/) to lock DE in the smart contract and issue TBY. Keep in mind that you also need MATICs for a transaction fee. 

3. Make sure you have enough TBY to launch DeNet Datakeeper in [DeNet Payments](https://pay.denet.app/). Required TBY amount is equal to your Node ID. 
You can take a look at current node supply in [contract](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xcb19bede3e4f64b6b0085d99127f6d0a25b7180d). That means if there are already 5 nodes in the contract, you will be the sixth to register there and your ID is going to be number 6 in this contract. That also means that you must have 6 TBY on your balance in order to register your node.
